**Intro to Data Science Notes**
- High level intro of field
- Not sure the best way to make this
    - Should I use a markdown file and edit in VS Code?
    - Or should I use a Jupyter Notebook and just do pure markdown there?
        - This seems like the best option since cells can be ran and markdown rendered properly
    - Should I experiment with Sublime Text editor?
    - Should I even review this section or just skip straight to sections where I can code along in a Jupyter Notebook?
